# Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: No Internet Access
- Use `ping 8.8.8.8`
  - If ping fails, it may be a local network or ISP issue.
  - If it works but websites donâ€™t load, check DNS.

## Problem: Website Not Loading
- Use `nslookup` to check DNS resolution.
  - If DNS fails, try switching to public DNS like 8.8.8.8.

## Problem: Network is Slow
- Use `tracert google.com` to identify slow hops or timeouts.
  - This helps determine if latency is due to your network or upstream.

## Problem: Confirm IP Address or Gateway
- Use `ipconfig /all`
  - Check for assigned IP, default gateway, and DHCP status.
