NETWORKING LAB REPORT

Tools Used:
- ping
- ipconfig
- tracert
- nslookup

System Info:
- Windows 10 Laptop
- Connected to Home Wi-Fi Network

Objective:
To explore the use of basic command-line networking tools and understand how to troubleshoot connectivity problems.

Findings:
I used 'ping' to verify that my internet connection was active by sending requests to Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8). The results showed successful replies, confirming connectivity.

The 'ipconfig' command revealed my local IP address, gateway, and DNS server. I redacted sensitive information like my MAC address before uploading.

Using 'tracert', I observed the path packets take from my computer to Google's server, including hop-by-hop delays. This can be useful in identifying slow network segments.

With 'nslookup', I confirmed that domain names like openai.com properly resolve to IP addresses, which is crucial for browser access.

Conclusion:
This lab gave me practical experience with key diagnostic tools and improved my ability to identify and resolve basic networking issues at home or in a professional IT environment.
